New Features and Improvements:
Fractional Indicator in the Home Page:

A fractional indicator has been added to the Home page to help users track the current word they are viewing and see how many words are left in the list.
Smooth Animation on Word Tap:

Added a smooth animation when tapping on a word, transitioning the user to a detailed view of the word. This provides a more engaging experience with a clearer layout compared to the original app.
